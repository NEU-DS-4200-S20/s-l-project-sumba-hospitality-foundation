- Good progress
- I still don't get the interaction for the vis on the landing page. 
So please a note before the vis that describe what the user can do.

^ this is actually really interesting. Could you make the info popup on scrolling over the country and not just the flag?

^ well thoughtout and laid out. I like the desciptions on the side.

^ I don't get much out of this and given its not interactive, only so much can be obtained without descriptions, 
but I guess you are implementing it. 

Great work so far! Good luck for the final lap.
